# linear_regression_scrach
This is a jupyter nootebook file where i have trained a model using linear regression for multiple variables to be able to predict "Yearly amount spent by a customer" based on some data about the customer given by the ecommerce dataset manually writing python function with use of popular python libraries numpy and pandas. This file also explains Linear regression its concepts and it also explains each function and its usecase and why it is required. I have also performed some Explaratory Data Analysis of the dataset along with evaluating the models performance.


# linear_regression_sklearn
I have also trained the model using linear regression in this file but it was done using the sklearn library which is the main library used for Machine Learning in real world projects. This file also has some exploratory data analysis on the dataset answell as model acuracy evaluation at the end.
