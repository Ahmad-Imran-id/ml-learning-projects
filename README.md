# linear_regression_ecommerce
This is a jupyter nootebook file where i have trained a model using linear regression for multiple variables to be able to predict "Yearly amount spent by a customer" based on some data about the customer given by the ecommerce dataset manually writing python function with use of popular python libraries numpy and pandas. This file also explains Linear regression its concepts and it also explains each function and its usecase and why it is required. I have also performed some Explaratory Data Analysis of the dataset along with evaluating the models performance.
