# Machine Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly machine learning projects that I am building as part of my self-learning journey in Machine Learning. Each project includes both a **from-scratch implementation** (using only NumPy/Pandas) and a **scikit-learn implementation** to compare theory vs practice.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Practice implementing core ML algorithms from scratch
- Compare with real-world libraries (scikit-learn)
- Evaluate models with appropriate metrics

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. Linear Regression (E-commerce Dataset)
- Implemented from scratch using gradient descent
- Compared with scikit-learnâ€™s `LinearRegression`
- Includes exploratory data analysis with Seaborn
- [Project folder](./linear_regression_ecommerce)

### 2. Logistic Regression (Spam Email Classifier)
- Implemented from scratch (sigmoid, cost function, gradient descent)
- Compared with scikit-learnâ€™s `LogisticRegression`
- Dataset: SMS Spam Collection
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall
- [Project folder](./spam_classifier_logistic_regression)
