# Linear Regression - E-commerce Customer Spending

This project implements a **regression model** to predict the **Yearly Amount Spent by a customer** based on multiple input features from an e-commerce dataset. The project has two parts:
1. **Manual implementation** of linear regression using Python, NumPy, and Pandas
2. **scikit-learn implementation** using `LinearRegression`

## ðŸ“˜ Project Details

### 1. linear_regression_scratch.ipynb
- Implements linear regression from scratch:
  - Cost function 
  - Gradient descent
- Explains each step with Python functions and markdown notes
- Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn
- Evaluates model performance with error metrics

### 2. linear_regression_sklearn.ipynb
- Trains a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Compares performance with the manual implementation
- Includes additional exploratory data analysis
- Evaluates the modelâ€™s accuracy and regression fit
